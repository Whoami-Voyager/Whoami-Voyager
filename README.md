# Hello There üëã

With a foundation in software engineering from Flatiron School's immersive program, I've honed my skills in full-stack web development, mastering languages like Python, JavaScript, and frameworks such as Flask. Through hands-on projects and collaborative environments, I've gained a deep understanding of fundamental programming concepts and advanced technologies, preparing me to tackle real-world challenges with confidence and creativity.

I'm excited to apply my expertise in web development to drive impactful solutions and drive positive change. Whether it's building intuitive user interfaces or optimizing backend systems for performance and scalability, I'm committed to delivering high-quality solutions that exceed expectations.

For many years now, I have always wanted to create. Both web development and photography have allowed me to pursue that to another level. I have always loved technology, and I can never imagine myself without it. Although it is good to go outside once in a while and touch some grass. Nature is beautiful.

Outside of the digital realm, I'm also an avid photographer with a keen eye for capturing moments and the beauty of nature. With experience as a photographer at Lake of the Trees Bible Camp, I've had the privilege of preserving memories through photographs and videos.

# Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

### [LeMans100](https://github.com/thekaleabsamuel/Le-mans-100-v1)
In celebration of 100 years of the endurance race held in Le Mans, France this website was built.
- Used Javascript to append HTML to the DOM to make a dynamic website based on adding to removing from dataset
- Stylized the website using CSS with custom colors and fonts to make the visuals match the theme of the website
- Collaborated with a classmate to make all the assets and added functionality, like clicking the cars make an exhaust sound

### [TechHistoria](https://github.com/Whoami-Voyager/TechHistoria)
I have always found history and technology fascinating, so I decided to build a timeline that combines both.
- Learned React and component to build a frontend, using props, state, and JSX
- Styled the HTML within the website using Tailwind, further solidifying my understanding of flexbox and styling
- Created a JSON backend with a Post feature with a controlled form to send new events to the backend

### [CarChronicle](https://github.com/Whoami-Voyager/CarChronicle)
Using a web scraper, I was able to create a reasonably sized database to make an archive of car models and companies.
- Used Python to establish classes and class methods, allowing to manipulate the SQLite tables
- Created a Seed file that uses a web scraper called Beautiful Soup to fill the database tables
- Used several Python components to create lists for the user to choose for better UX, and a loading bar for the seed file

### [InstaVibe](https://github.com/Whoami-Voyager/InstaVibe)
Creating an Instagram replica using Flask as a backend to build out my first full-stack project.
- First Full-Stack project, using React as our frontend and fetching from a Flask backend
- Creating a secure Login and Logout, Hashing the passwords in the backend with salt, secure key, not sending any sensitive data to the frontend
- Using Flask to create a RestFul API, Manipulating SQLite tables

### [LandMarkLore](https://github.com/Whoami-Voyager/LandmarkLore)
The term sonder comes to mind when I created this app, with the purpose being to tell stories anywhere in the world.
- Used Leaflet.js to create a navigable map, allowing users to tell stories and leave markers anywhere in the world
- Users may optionally upload photos to Cloudinary with their posts, deleted markers deleting it from the database
- Capstone project for Flatiron School
